This task is quite difficult, because it requires some knowledge of number theory.
Nevertheless the key to efficient algorithm is finding the formula of all unconcealed messages
for given secret key e.

The unconcealed message by the definition is the message:

$m^e \equiv m$ (mod n)

This is equivalent to 2 equations:

$m^e \equiv m$ (mod p)
$m^e \equiv m$ (mod q)

Let's solve the first one.
The trivial solution is m = 0. The other solutions can be found by solving this equation:

$m^{e-1} \equiv 1$ (mod p)

This equation has at least one solution which is: $m \equiv 1$ (mod p). Generally all solutions
are in the form of $g^k$ where g is one of the primitive root modulo p and 0 <= k < p - 1. Substituting $g^k$ we obtain:

$g^{k*(e-1)} \equiv 1$ (mod p)
The order of g that is the least value of exponent n where $g^n \equiv 1 $ (mod p) is p-1, because g is the primitive root modulo p, and the order of any primitive root is $\phi(n)$ which is Euler's totient function.

Hence we have that:
 $p-1$ | $k*(e-1)$

 If gcd(p-1, e-1) = d then we have that: $\dfrac{p-1}{d}$ | $k * \dfrac{e-1}{d}$ which means
that:
  $\dfrac{p-1}{d}$ | $k$, because $gcd(\dfrac{p-1}{d},\dfrac{e-1}{d}) = 1$

  In other words k is multiple of $\dfrac{p-1}{d}$ and 0<=k<=d-1 which means there are d solutions to
the equation:
  $m^(e-1) \equiv 1$ (mod p)
Together with trivial solution m = 0, we have $1+d=1+gcd(e-1,p-1)$ solutions of the equation

$m^e \equiv m$ (mod p)

Similarly we have $1+gcd(e-1,q-1)$ to the equation:

$m^e \equiv m$ (mod q)

Every possible pair of solutions of these 2 equations gives unique solution mod p*q. (from Chinese Reminder Theory)
So the total number of solutions that is the total number of unconcealed messages for given encryption key e is:

$(1+gcd(e-1,p-1))*(1+gcd(e-1,q-1))$

Let's first check if gcd(e-1,p-1) = 1 and gcd(e-1,q-1) = 1 can be solution. Becuase both p-1 and q-1 are even numbers the e-1 must be odd. This means that e is even, but then gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) > 1
becuase (p-1)(q-1) is even. So those e for which gcd(e-1,p-1) = 1 and gcd(e-1,q-1) = 1 cannot be taken to the final sum. This also means that the minimum number of solutions is 9.


The final algorithm is straightforward. It takes all possible values of e and take only those for which gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1 and the number of unconcealed messages is minimum that is 9.
