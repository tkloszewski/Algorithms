This problem can be transformed into a problem of evaluating sums of the form

Sum over e = 1 to all phi / (h * p1 * p2 * p3 * ..pj) : (he - 1)
over a system of linear congruences
{ he - 1 = 0, 1 (mod p1), ... he - 1 = 0,1 (mod pi)}

where 5 <= p1 < ... < pi < .... < pj < ... pn
are distinct prime factors of the Carmichael totient lambda(n)
and subsequently adding up the sums using the inclusion-exclusion principle
based on the number of equations chosen in each system. The value of h depends on phi(p *q) (mod 24)

This algorithm can be derived from the constraint

                 gcd(phi(n), e) = 1

 and observation that

                 gcd(lambda(n), e - 1) = 2

 when the number of unconcealed messages for  is minimum. Ergo, this algorithm is equivalent to
 summing up all potential candidates for  and then subtracting those candidates that fail to meet the constraints.
  The prime factorization for large numbers in the ballpark of

                lambda(n) < phi(n) <= phi(99999937 * 999999927) ~= 10^18

can be computed rapidly using the Pollard's rho algorithm. Some care is needed to prevent loss of
precision while dividing big numbers in Pollard's algorithm. Each system of linear congruences can be
solved via the Chinese remainder theorem.
